1. [Rails] By default everything in an Engine is namespaced, you will see controllers,
models and every other stuff wrapped inside module, this is used to avoid clushing 
and to logically separate entities of engine from a main application.

2. [Rails] You can actually have attr_accessor macroses in the module,
logically those macroses are just creating writer methods and readers so 
for ruby it's just methods, but anyway, you can use that approach and then include
it to class, you'll get those fields.
