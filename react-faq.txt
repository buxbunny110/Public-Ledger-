1. [Libs] What is final-form and how it differs from react-final-form

- final-form is the standalone library which is framework agnostic which means,
it can interact with any framework, it's not dependent on any, in fact it uses its
internal state mechanism, you can even use it in vanila JS. react-final-form is the
wrapper made around it, which helps you to forget about the overall overhead, it gives
you fancy hooks and components you can use to focus purely in react way, sort of things,
also it's much easier, to integrate than more raw, final-form solution in react.
