1. What are Rails engines

- Rail engines are base engine drivers of every rails application, even the
Application itself inherits from Engine class, mainly engines are used to isolate
some kind of structured logic and action, it's more like a plugin, 
you can mount the engine into your application and it in turn will extend your main
Application functionality.
