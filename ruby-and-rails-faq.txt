1. What are Rails engines

- Rail engines are base engine drivers of every rails application, even the
Application itself inherits from Engine class, mainly engines are used to isolate
some kind of structured logic and action, it's more like a plugin, 
you can mount the engine into your application and it in turn will extend your main
Application functionality.


2. What's the difference between include and extend while using it to include module in class

- include is used to treat methods as instance methods whereas extend treats included methods as 
class methods

3. What are ! signs used for in the end of method name, ie postfix

- These may indicate two things, either method modifies receiver, for example 
two cases String.upcase and String.upcase!, first one gives you copy second one
changes the string at place, or the bang may indicate presence of possible exception,
for example, you can have "update" method and "update!" method, first one 
return boolean, second one will raise exception, therefore bang methods are considered as 
'dangerous'. Also bang methods are really good at saving memmory.
