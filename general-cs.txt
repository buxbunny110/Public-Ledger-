1. What is the deep link

- Deep link is anything but homepage, any link which accesses to some page is
considered as deep link, but mainly in my opinion deep link is the complex URL
which contains nested paths, and query strings, by which web page can determine 
intention of the user, for example www.example.com/ads?showmore=true
can be considered as deep link, because it does two actions, ie goes deep,
first it goes to route by /ads path then by query string, it can show detailed information,
or pop up some modal, or do some advanced thing, like a parameter for CLI, example would be
git checkout -b, we know that git is just a top level command, checkout is subcommand, analogy of url it would be
a path, not quite same but still, and -b is option/flag indicator of what additional action needs to be done
so basically URL in essense really familiar to commands. Honestly when someone says a link, it's a 99% just a deep 
link, otherwise everyone would just say, go to site with name of such and such. most of the time links being 
sent accross net contains more info like paths and query strings, even segments, which can be used as 
navigation to certain html elements.

www.git.com/checkout?b=true can be analogy of real CLI command
